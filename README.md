# Graph Tasks

Solutions for graph algorithm tasks.

## Implemented Tasks

- `task1.1` - graph implementation and RPO numbering with cycle detection.
- `task1.2` - Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
- `task1.3` - maximum flow using Dinic's algorithm.
- `task1.4` - Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components.

The shared graph implementation is placed in `common`.

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

After the build, executables are available in the `build` directory:

```text
build/task1_1
build/task1_2
build/task1_3
build/task1_4
```

## Run

Example:

```bash
./build/task1_2 < tests/task1.2/01.in
```

## Tests

Tests are stored in the `tests` directory as `.in` / `.out` pairs.

Run all tests:

```bash
python3 tests/tasks_tester.py
```

## Requirements

- C++23
- CMake 3.20+
- `g++` or a compatible compiler
- `python3` for running tests
